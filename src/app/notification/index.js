          ReactJs is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
          building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by
          Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React
          can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile
          applications.

          ReactJs is a library for building composable user interfaces. It
          encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data
          that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC.
          React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming
          model and better performance. React can also render on the server
          using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React
          implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate
          and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
